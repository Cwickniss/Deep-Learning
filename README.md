# Deep Learning
I has Successfully completed Deep Learning Specialization from Coursera by Andrew Ng.I have also done  
different courses from Udemy which is Deep Learning A-Z by krill and Some other course base on Libraries Some base on theoratical 
and Some base on Practical which I have learn.I have also read different blogs, research papers to boost up my Deep Learning concept.
After learn all of this I make a diferrent projects on Deep Learning which I upload in this Repositories taken dataset from different 
Sources like UCI, Kaggle, Stanford.I also done #100DaysMLCode Challenges.I also writing a blog on Machine Learning & Deep Learning 
artices from Scratch on medium.I have a Publication on Deep Learning base on Supervised Deep Learning Model use Multi Layer 
Perceptrons model.Reference of my paper:'Application of Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) for Data Mining in Healthcare Operations'.

The following Projects which I have done In Deep Learning:

   ## <------------------------------Supervised Deep Learning ----------------------------->

### Project 1: Artificial Neural Networks to solve a Customer Churn problem
In this part we solve a data analytics challenge for a bank. The dataset with a large sample of  the bank's customers. To make this 
dataset, the bank gathered information such as customer id, credit score, gender, age, tenure, balance, if the customer is active, 
has a credit card, etc. During a period of 6 months, the bank observed if these customers left or stayed in the bank. We use Artificial 
Neural Network(ANN) that can predict, based on geo-demographical and transactional information given above, if any individual customer
will leave the bank or stay (customer churn). Besides, we asked to rank all the customers of the bank, based on their probability of 
leaving. To do that, we use the right Deep Learning model, one that is based on a probabilistic approach. And in the End we create 
significant added value to the bank. By applying Deep Learning model the bank may significantly reduce customer churn.
And in the end we get a 84.05% of Churn problem.

### Project 2: Convolutional Neural Networks for Image Recognition
In this part, we create a Convolutional Neural Network that is able to detect various objects in images. We implement this Deep 
Learningmodel to recognize a cat or a dog in a set of pictures. However, this model can be reused to detect anything else and we  
just simply replace the dataset of image folder with another dataset. For example, you will be able to train the same model on a
set of brain images, to detect if they contain a tumor or not. But if you want to keep it fitted to cats and dogs, then you will 
literally be able to a takea picture of your cat or your dog, and your model will predict which pet you have.In this project we 
train our cat and dog dataset which contains ten thousands images of cat and dog and we train 80% image for training and remaining 
20% image for testing and weget more than 80% accuracy. After this we just test only take one image of cat and Dog than predict 
using Sigmoid function in output layer and our model correctly predict.

### Project 3: Recurrent Neural Networks to predict Google Stock Prices
In this part, you create one of the most powerful Deep Learning models. We will even go as far as saying that you will create 
the Deep Learning model closest to “Artificial Intelligence”. Why is that? Because this model will have long-term memory,
just like us, humans. The branch of Deep Learning which facilitates this is Recurrent Neural Networks. Classic RNNs have 
short memory, and were neither popular nor powerful for this exact reason. But a recent major improvement in Recurrent Neural
Networks gave rise to the popularity of LSTMs (Long Short Term Memory RNNs) which has completely changed the playing field.
We are extremely excited to include these cutting-edge deep learning methods in our course! In this part you we implement 
this ultra-powerful model, and we take the challenge to use it to predict the real Google stock price. A similar challenge
has already been faced by researchers at Stanford University and we to do at least as good as them.In the end we train 200
number of epoch after building our model we get more than 85% of real time Google Stock Price Prediction. And In the end 
we compare our result with real time Google stock price and our predicted line is almost close to real time Google stock price.

## <----------------------------Unsupervised Deep Learning --------------------------->

### Project 4: Self-Organizing Maps to investigate Fraud
According to a recent report published by Markets & Markets the Fraud Detection and Prevention Market is going to be worth 
$33.19 Billion USD by 2021. This is a huge industry and the demand for advanced Deep Learning skills is only going to grow. 
We use Unsupervised Deep Learning Models which is Self-Organization Map. The business challenge here is about detecting fraud 
in credit card applications. We create a Deep Learning model for a bank and given a dataset that contains information on customers
applying for an advanced credit card. This is the data that customers provided when filling the application form. We detect 
potential fraud within these applications. That means that by the end of the challenge, we build a Self Organization maps iterally
come up with an explicit list of customers who potentially cheated on their applications.

### Project 5: Boltzmann Machines to create a Recommender System for Movies Ratings
From Amazon product suggestions to Netflix movie recommendations - good recommender systems are very valuable in today's World.
And specialists who can create them are some of the top-paid Data Scientists on the planet.We work on a dataset that has exactly
the same features as the Netflix dataset: plenty of movies, thousands of users, who have rated the movies they watched. 
The ratings go from 1 to 5, exactly like in the Netflix dataset, which makes the Recommender System more complex to build 
than if the ratings were simply “Liked” or “Not Liked”. Our final Recommender System able to predict the ratings of the movies 
the customers didn’t watch. Accordingly, by ranking the predictions from 5 down to 1, our Deep Learning model able to recommend
which movies each user should watch. We use our model Deep Belief Networks, complex Boltzmann. The list of movies explicit so 
simply need to rate the movies you already watched, input your ratings in the dataset, execute our model and voila! The Recommender
System will tell you exactly which movies you would love one night you if are out of ideas of what to watch on Netflix!
